    <h2>Funding</h2>
    <p>
      The Blue Ridge Cemetery is <strong>not owned or funded by the city</strong>. It is lovingly maintained by the generous support of individuals in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year, on the <strong>first Sunday in May</strong>, the <strong>Cemetery Association meets</strong> to elect board members, discuss new and old business, and review the cemetery's financial information. This weekend is also known as <strong>Decoration Weekend</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Donations</strong> can be mailed to:<br>
      <strong>Blue Ridge Cemetery Incorporated</strong><br>
      PO Box 122<br>
      Blue Ridge, TX 75424
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in 2025, <strong>First Baptist Church</strong>, located less than a quarter mile from the cemetery, has graciously offered to receive <strong>online donations</strong> on behalf of the cemetery at no cost.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "We are happy to help the cemetery by offering our website as a portal for online giving. We are already set up, and those donations can now be marked specifically for the cemetery in our giving portal. In fact, it is a privilege for us, as so many of our former members have been laid to rest on that very hill."
      </p>
