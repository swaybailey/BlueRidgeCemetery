      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p>The Blue Ridge Cemetery is <strong>not owned or funded by the city</strong>. It is maintained by the generous funding of people in the community.</p>
      <p>Once a year on the <strong>first Sunday in May</strong>, the cemetery association meets to elect board members, discuss any new or old business, as well as view the financial information for the cemetery. That weekend is <strong>Decoration Weekend</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Donations</strong> can be mailed to:<br>
      <strong>Blue Ridge Cemetery Incorporated</strong><br>
      PO Box 122<br>
      Blue Ridge, TX 75424</p>
      <p>Starting in 2025, <strong>First Baptist Church</strong>, located less than a quarter mile from the cemetery, has graciously agreed to accept <strong>online donations</strong> on behalf of the cemetery. This service allows for convenient, cost-free online giving. You can donate online at <a href="https://firstblueridge.org/give" target="_blank">firstblueridge.org/give</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"We are happy to help the cemetery by offering our website as a portal for online giving. We are already setup and those donations can now be marked specifically for the cemetery in our giving portal. In fact, it is a privilege for us, as so many of our former members have been laid to rest on that very hill. -Pastor Shawn Bailey"</p>
